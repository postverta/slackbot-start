# Slack bot starter app

This simple app demonstrates how to write a Slack bot using Slack's official
node SDK. It can send message to your Slack channel through a web interface.

## Running the app

You first need a development API token from Slack. To obtain one, login to
your team on Slack's website, and go to the following URL:

<https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens>

Add the token to the `.env` file, and you are all set!

## Next step

Hope you are having fun so far! As a next step, you can try to add an incoming
message hook so that we can receive messages sent from Slack.  You can follow
the instruction at:
